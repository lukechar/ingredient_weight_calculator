# ingredient_weight_calculator

This spring, as the covid-19 pandemic began to shatter all sense of normalcy and keep me at home for long periods of time, I decided the best thing to do was to pick up a productive new hobby. Given its recent popularity on social media, I figured baking various incarnations of sourdough bread was the way to go.

I really enjoy the hobby, but as someone with an experimentalist background, I was getting pretty annoyed by the old imperial British units that baking recipes usually use in the US of A. Also, when it comes to baking ingredients, volume is inherently tricky due to variability in ingredient moisture and what your definition of what "packed" flour looks like. Weight is used by professional bakers when determining ingredient amounts because it is much more reliable and consistent.

Thus, I decided to create this Django app which makes it easy to convert most common baking ingredients from their imperial volume/weights to metric weight.

The app is still in-progress, but is fully functional at this point and it has sped up my baking process by a significant amount (and saved me from washing measuring cups!).

Aesetic improvements to come, but I plan on keeping the UI relatively simple + clean. The frontend utilizes the Twitter Bootstrap framework and is mobile-friendly.

Suggestions and pull requests welcome.
